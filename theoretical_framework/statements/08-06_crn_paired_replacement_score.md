**In one paragraph.** This definition fixes the measurement used by Theorem C: at one audited state, each candidate feedback law gets one round, and then every candidate runs the same surrogate tail with the same random numbers. The paired difference of the surrogate scores is the measured quantity.

**Setting used on this page.**

The objects of [Definitions 1.3–1.4](../README.md#s1-3) are used throughout.

- Rounds are $`t=0,\dots,R-1`$, and $`z`$ is a complete learner state. For a first-order optimizer the actual update is $`U_t(z,y,\xi)=z+\Delta_t\big(z,G_t(z,y,\xi)\big)`$.
- At state $`z`$ in round $`t`$ the reference emits $`Y\sim P^0_{t,z}`$, and candidate $`j\in\lbrace1,\dots,M\rbrace`$ emits $`Y\sim P^j_{t,z}`$. The kernel of candidate $`j`$ is $`K^j_t`$.
- The reference continuation is $`V^0_{t+1}`$, with $`V^0_R=F_E\in[0,1]`$. The response is $`g_{t,z}(y)=\mathbb E_\xi V^0_{t+1}(U_t(z,y,\xi))\in[0,1]`$. Integrating the message gives the kernel identity

```math
(K^j_tV^0_{t+1})(z)=\mathbb E_{Y\sim P^j_{t,z}}\,g_{t,z}(Y),\qquad j\in\lbrace0,1,\dots,M\rbrace .\qquad\text{(K)}
```

- $`L_E(j)=\mathbb E\,F_E(Z^j_R)`$ for the process driven by candidate $`j`$. All processes start from the same initial law of $`Z_0`$.
- The *local advantage* of candidate $`j`$ at $`(t,z)`$ is

```math
A_t(z,j)=(K^j_t-K^0_t)V^0_{t+1}(z)\in[-1,1].
```

- It is the effect on the final score of replacing one reference round by one round of candidate $`j`$, followed by the reference tail. By [Theorem 3.2](../statements/03-02_continuation_response_characterization.md#s3-2), the whole-run difference is a sum of such terms over the states the alternative process reaches.

**Definition 8.6 (CRN paired-replacement score).**

- Fix an audited state $`z`$ at round $`t`$ (a complete learner state, including the optimizer state), conditionally on the history that produced it. The candidates are $`j=0,1,\dots,M`$ with $`M\ge1`$; $`j=0`$ is the reference. Candidate $`j`$ has message law $`P^j=P^j_t(\cdot\mid z)`$, and a message $`Y`$ produces the increment $`\Delta^j=\Delta_t(z,G_t(z,Y,\xi))`$, update randomness included.
- A *surrogate tail* $`T_\omega`$ maps a state to a final state by running a declared (possibly truncated) reference tail with randomness $`\omega`$. A *surrogate objective* $`\tilde F`$ scores the final state (for example, the teacher-forced log-likelihood of held-out successful trajectories, mapped to $`[0,1]`$). Write

```math
\varphi_\omega(u)=\tilde F\big(T_\omega(z+u)\big),\qquad\tilde L(P^j)=\mathbb E\,\varphi_\omega(\Delta^j),
```

where $`\omega`$ is independent of $`\Delta^j`$. $`\tilde L(P^j)`$ is the surrogate outcome of one round with candidate $`j`$ followed by the surrogate tail.

- *Replicas* $`\ell=1,\dots,r`$, $`r\ge2`$: draw a fresh $`\omega_\ell`$ and, for every candidate, one message and its increment $`\Delta^j_\ell`$. All candidates in replica $`\ell`$ share $`\omega_\ell`$ (*common random numbers*); their messages may also be coupled through common random numbers, as long as each $`\Delta^j_\ell`$ has its correct marginal law. Replicas are independent of each other.
- If a candidate's message law has finite support, the draw may be replaced by the exact weighted average over the support; the randomness then comes only from $`\omega`$.
- The score of the ordered pair $`(j,k)`$ is

```math
Z^{jk}_\ell=\varphi_{\omega_\ell}(\Delta^j_\ell)-\varphi_{\omega_\ell}(\Delta^k_\ell),\qquad\hat S^{jk}=\frac1r\sum_{\ell=1}^rZ^{jk}_\ell .
```

- On the task side, $`L_F(P^j)=\mathbb E\,F_E\big(T^{\rm full}(z+\Delta^j)\big)`$ is the outcome of one round with candidate $`j`$ followed by the full reference tail and the task objective. In the notation of the setting, $`L_F(P^j)=(K^j_tV^0_{t+1})(z)`$, so $`L_F(P^j)-L_F(P^0)=A_t(z,j)`$.

**What it is.** The CRN paired-replacement score of an ordered pair of candidates at an audited state: one round with each candidate, followed by a shared surrogate tail, scored by a surrogate objective, averaged over independent replicas.

**Role in the framework.** It is the measurement of Theorem 8.8 and its first-order variant in Corollary 8.9, and the selection statistic of the method.
